# Nerf-MA40-Dart-Counter
Nerf blaster visual dart counter and clip capacity detector.

Please note that this project was created as a senior project and for fun therefore I will not be able to help answer any questions or fix any problems that may arise. I also take no responsibility if you damage you blaster or injure yourself by modifying it.

Parts List:
  - One Arduino compatible board of some kind
  - Two Hall Effect sensors
  - One I2C OLED Screen
  - One microswitch/limit switch
